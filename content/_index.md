# Mettle & Byte Ltd

## Introduction

Sitting at the intersection of the digital and physical worlds, Mettle & Byte was founded in late 2023 and focuses on software that runs hardware, and hardware that runs software - specifically in the areas of manufacturing and industrial control.

Our current work includes supporting the [Millennium Machines](https://github.com/millenniummachines) project, where we are responsible for the implementation of [MillenniumOS](https://github.com/MillenniumMachines/MillenniumOS/) - a package of functionality built on top of RepRapFirmware that guides new users through their first steps in subtractive manufacturing (milling).

## Hardware

[Ultralight N17](./hardware/ultralight-n17/r1.5/) - a NEMA17-footprint smart motor controller, compatible with RRF, Klipper and even SimpleFOC!

## Services

* Open-Source software and hardware development and testing.
* Software, cloud and devops consulting.
* Prototype milling and finishing services.
* Product design for manufacture.

## Ethos

Simply - we aim to be a **net-positive** to humanity and our world. We will _not_ work with companies or in industries that are a **net-negative**. That means no fossil-fuel companies, no defence companies, no hypercapitalist practices or predatory behaviour. Do better.
